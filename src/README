@forward '../FolderName/FileName'; - is always in _index.scss file in every sub-folder in SASS folder

@use in style.scss/main.scss file only uses folder names example: @use 'base';

@use in subfolders is used in scss files and not in index file. 

@use while used in subfolder files is used as in the example: @use '../FolderName/FileName'; 

While using @use in files in subfolders you have to secify a file from which variable is coming from example: 

We have a $red variable in abstracts/colors.scss file, to use it we forward it using _index.scss file,
then in the file we want to use it in we say @use '../abstracts/colors';
But it`s not the end while using the $red variable we have to add colors. before its` name so it looks like this: background: colors.$red;

We can make it simpler using 'as' for example: @use '../abstracts/colors' as c;
Now we just write: background: c.$red; and it works.

How is this file structure working

Assets - all images, icons, fonts etc. are placed in there
Scripts - All of the JS stuff is placed in here

SASS - folder i a complex one, containing 5 subfolders or more if you want to in which are files secific for those things.

Abstracts- Are all the things that are not compiled into CSS, things like color maps, maps etc.
Base - Here you set your total reset, basic thing that always are part of the site and affect all global things
Components - Are individual components, that can be used and reused 
Layouts - Page related stuff or section related stuff when dealing with single page layouts. Basically how your site looks
Utilities - Classes that are used all the time and need specific styling. All od them are single files
